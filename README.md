# Cryptocurrency PCA 
The purpose of this project was to take cryptocurrency trading and mining data and run PCA on it to determine tradeable cryptocurrencies.<br>

The process was broken down into four deliverables:
1. Preprocess data for PCA
2. Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA
3. Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means
4. Visualize the results using `hvplot`
